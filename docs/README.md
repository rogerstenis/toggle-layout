A layout that renders it's content, on demand, controlled via site editor

‚ö†Ô∏è This app works not as visibility, but as displaying it's content passed

![Site editor example](../img/toggleLayout.png)

## Configuration

- Add this app as a theme dependency in the `manifest.json` file

```json
"dependencies": {
    "vtex.toggle-layout": "0.x"
}
```

- Add `toggle-layout` block and declare it's content via the children prop

```json
"toggle-layout": {
    "children": [
      "rich-text#title",
      "info-card#example"
      ]
  }
```

Now the user has access to a `Toggle Layout` block inside site editor, that can manipulate on demand
